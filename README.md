# Deploying-Cloud-Infra
Welcome to the Cloud Microservices Deployment project! This project showcases a Python Flask-based microservice deployed across leading cloud platforms: AWS ECS Fargate, GCP Cloud Run, and Azure Container Instances. By leveraging containerization with Docker and automated CI/CD pipelines, this project demonstrates a secure, highly available, and scalable cloud architecture.

The goal of this project is to highlight the use of cloud-native tools and Well-Architected Framework principles (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization) in deploying microservices.

This project uses Docker containerization and CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment on **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**.


## **Key Features**
1. **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: AWS, GCP, and Azure.
2. **Containerization**: Dockerized Flask application.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines**: AWS CodePipeline and GCP Cloud Build.
4. **High Availability**: Load Balancers, Auto-Scaling, and private networking.
5. **Security**: VPC, security groups, and container scanning.
6. **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC): Repeatable and consistent deployments.
