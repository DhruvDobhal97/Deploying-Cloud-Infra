# Deploying-Cloud-Infra
Welcome to the Cloud Microservices Deployment project! This project showcases a Python Flask-based microservice deployed across leading cloud platforms: AWS ECS Fargate, GCP Cloud Run, and Azure Container Instances. By leveraging containerization with Docker and automated CI/CD pipelines, this project demonstrates a secure, highly available, and scalable cloud architecture.

The goal of this project is to highlight the use of cloud-native tools and Well-Architected Framework principles (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization) in deploying microservices.
